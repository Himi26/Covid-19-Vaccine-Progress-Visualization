# Covid-19 Vaccination Progress Visualization Using Tableau

## ðŸ“„ About

The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant impact on various social groups, with vulnerable populations often being disproportionately affected. The emergence of different variants has further complicated the situation. However, the rollout of effective vaccinations against COVID-19 has brought some much-needed relief.

Visualizing vaccination data through a Dashboard or Story point presentation can provide valuable insights into the current vaccine scenario. By presenting data in an interactive and visually appealing manner, such visualizations can help stakeholders, policymakers, and the general public understand and analyze vaccination trends, coverage rates, distribution strategies, and the overall progress of vaccination campaigns. This can aid in identifying areas that require more attention, optimizing resource allocation, and making informed decisions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

## ðŸ“„ Dataset

The data has been taken from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations) , which maintains, tracks & updates COVID-19 data in their Github repository on a regular basis.
Different flies are available for COVID-19 vaccination progress which requires cleaning and merging.

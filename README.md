# Covid-19 Vaccination Progress Visualization Using Tableau

## ðŸ“„ About

The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant impact on various social groups, with vulnerable populations often being disproportionately affected. The emergence of different variants has further complicated the situation. However, the rollout of effective vaccinations against COVID-19 has brought some much-needed relief.

Visualizing vaccination data through a Dashboard and Story point presentation  provide valuable insights into the current vaccine scenario. By presenting data in an interactive and visually appealing manner, such visualizations can help stakeholders, policymakers, and the general public understand and analyze vaccination trends, coverage rates, distribution strategies, and the overall progress of vaccination campaigns. This can aid in identifying areas that require more attention, optimizing resource allocation, and making informed decisions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

## ðŸ“„ Dataset

The data has been taken from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations) , which maintains, tracks & updates COVID-19 data in their Github repository on a regular basis.
Different flies are available for COVID-19 vaccination progress which requires cleaning and merging.

## ðŸ“‘ COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard 

The COVID-19 vaccination progress dashboard incorporates interactive features to enhance data exploration and analysis. These interactive features include filtering options and drill-down capabilities, allowing users to delve deeper into the data and gain more detailed insights. By utilizing filtering options, users can focus on specific criteria such as country, vaccine type, or population size, enabling targeted analysis based on their specific interests or research objectives.

Additionally, the dashboard provides drill-down capabilities,  to zoom in on specific regions, time periods, or demographic groups. This functionality allows for a more granular examination of the vaccination progress, facilitating the identification of trends, patterns, and disparities at different levels.

By incorporating these interactive features, the COVID-19 vaccination progress dashboard allows stakeholders, policymakers to explore the data from various angles, uncover insights, and make informed decisions based on the evolving vaccination landscape.
